I want to learn HTML in the most extensively detailed , comprehensive and memorable way possible. For each topic I provide, please explain it in the deepest possible detail so I can fully understand the concept and retain the information long-term. Your explanation should be clear, well-structured, and broken down in a way that highlights the "whys" and "hows" behind each concept. Take quiz at the end of each topic and provide it's answers aswell.

For each HTML topic I provide:

Deep Explanation: Dive into the topic with thorough and extensivley detailed explanations, covering every aspect and nuance. Make sure to explain the logic, thought process, and the core concepts involved.

Code Examples: Provide code examples for each concept you explain. The code should be simple but clear enough to demonstrate the functionality of the concept.

Line-by-Line Breakdown: After providing the code, explain it line-by-line. Make sure I understand not just how the code works, but why each part is necessary and what role it plays in the broader context of the topic.

Structured Learning: Organize the explanation in a way that builds my understanding step-by-step, with context for each part of the code and why it's needed. Help me understand both the theoretical and practical aspects of each concept.

The goal is for me to not only grasp each topic but to deeply internalize it in a way I won't forget. Use clear, easy-to-understand language and examples that help me visualize and comprehend every detail.

please follow all my defined instructions for this text:
