// Why Does JavaScript Return "object" for null?
// This behavior is a classic quirk in JavaScript, originating from a technical mistake
// made during the early design phase of the language.


// The Reason Behind typeof null Returning "object"

// Historical Mistake:
// When JavaScript was first created in 1995, `null` was treated internally as a pointer
// that didnâ€™t reference any object. The `typeof` operator was designed to return "object"
// for objects, and due to this implementation, `null` was mistakenly assigned the same "object" type.


// Backward Compatibility:
// By the time this issue was recognized, JavaScript had already been widely adopted in web browsers.
// Changing this behavior would have broken existing code on millions of websites and applications.
// As a result, the language kept the behavior of `typeof null === "object"` to ensure backward compatibility.


// Clarifying the Behavior:

// What does `null` mean?
// It explicitly represents "no value" or an "empty object reference."

// Difference between `undefined` and `null`:
// `undefined`: A variable is declared but has no assigned value.
// `null`: A variable's value is explicitly set to "empty."


// Example:
let x = null; 
console.log(typeof x); // Output: "object"


// Key Points:
// - `null` is **NOT** an object. It's simply that `typeof null` mistakenly returns "object."

// To correctly check if a value is `null`, use strict equality (===):
let y = null;
console.log(y === null); // Output: true


// Will This Ever Be Fixed?
// No, fixing this would break millions of websites and applications.
// Maintaining backward compatibility is a critical priority in JavaScript's evolution.
