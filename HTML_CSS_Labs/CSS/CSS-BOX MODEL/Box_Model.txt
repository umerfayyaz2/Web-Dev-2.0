The CSS box model is a concept that describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and the way their dimensions are calculated, including their content, padding, borders, and margins.

Detailed Explanation of Box Model:

The box model consists of four parts

Content Box:
-This is the area where your content (text, images, etc.) is displayed.
-The width and height of the content box are defined by the width and height properties of the element.

Padding Box:
-Padding is the space between the content box and the border.
-It creates a buffer around the content, making it more spacious.
-The padding property is used to set the padding. You can specify padding for each side individually (padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left) or use the shorthand padding to set all sides at once.

Border Box:
-The border surrounds the padding (if any) and content.
-The border property is used to set the border's width, style, and color. You can specify borders for each side individually (border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left) or use the shorthand border to set all sides at once.

Margin Box:
-Margin is the space outside the border, creating distance between the element and neighboring elements.
-The margin property is used to set the margin. You can specify margins for each side individually (margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left) or use the shorthand margin to set all sides at once.
